# QuLab: Alpha Strategy Pipeline Simulator

## Project Description

QuLab is a Streamlit application designed to simulate a simplified alpha strategy pipeline. This pipeline demonstrates the key stages of quantitative investment, including data processing, model prediction, portfolio optimization, and order execution.  The application is intended as an educational tool for those interested in quantitative finance and algorithmic trading. It allows users to explore how different stages interact and how adjusting parameters can impact overall strategy performance. This project is based on the principles outlined in the survey "Deep Learning to LLMs: A survey of AI in Quantitative Investment" [1].

## Features

*   **Modular Design:** The application is structured into four distinct pages, each representing a key stage of the alpha strategy pipeline:
    *   **Data Processing:** Generate and validate synthetic financial data.
    *   **Model Prediction:** (Future Implementation) Train and evaluate predictive models.
    *   **Portfolio Optimization:** (Future Implementation) Determine optimal asset allocation.
    *   **Order Execution:** (Future Implementation) Simulate trade execution and its impact.
*   **Interactive Interface:** Streamlit's interactive widgets allow users to adjust parameters and observe their effect on the pipeline.
*   **Synthetic Data Generation:** Generates realistic synthetic financial data for experimentation.
*   **Data Validation:** Validates the structure and integrity of the generated data.
*   **Clear Visualizations:** Uses Plotly and Seaborn to visualize financial data and model outputs.
*   **Educational Focus:** Provides clear explanations and learning goals for each stage of the pipeline.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher.
*   **Pip:** Python package installer.
*   **Streamlit:** Install using `pip install streamlit`.
*   **Numpy:** Install using `pip install numpy`.
*   **Pandas:** Install using `pip install pandas`.
*   **Matplotlib:** Install using `pip install matplotlib`.
*   **Seaborn:** Install using `pip install seaborn`.
*   **Plotly:** Install using `pip install plotly`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url>
    cd <your_repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd <your_repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3.  **Access the application:** Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

### Basic Usage Instructions

*   The application consists of four pages, accessible via the sidebar navigation.
*   Each page represents a stage in the alpha strategy pipeline.
*   On the "Data Processing" page, you can generate synthetic financial data by adjusting parameters such as the number of assets, the number of days, and the start date.
*   Future pages (Model Prediction, Portfolio Optimization, and Order Execution) will provide interactive controls to explore those stages in more detail as they are implemented.
*   A random seed can be configured in the `app.py` file to ensure reproducibility of the generated data.
