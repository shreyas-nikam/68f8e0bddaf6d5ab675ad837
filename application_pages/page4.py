    This page addresses **Order Execution**, the final step in translating investment decisions into actual market trades.
    The goal is to implement the optimized portfolio allocation by strategically placing and managing trades to minimize market impact costs and ensure timely execution.

    ### Business Value
    Efficient order execution is critical for preserving the $\alpha$ generated by the strategy. Poor execution can erode potential profits through high transaction costs, slippage, and adverse market impact. Optimizing this stage ensures that the theoretical returns from prediction and optimization are realized in practice.

    ### Future Implementation
    This section will be expanded to include:
    -   Simulation of trade orders based on portfolio changes.
    -   Consideration of transaction costs and market impact.
    -   Visualization of executed trades and their costs.
    -   Interactive components to simulate different execution algorithms.
