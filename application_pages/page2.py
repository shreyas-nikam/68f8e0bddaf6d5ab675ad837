    This page is dedicated to **Model Prediction**, a crucial stage in the alpha strategy pipeline.
    In this phase, we would typically use machine learning models to forecast future asset performance, such as returns or price movements, based on the processed data.

    ### Business Value
    Accurate model predictions are the foundation for generating $\alpha$. By leveraging sophisticated algorithms, we aim to identify patterns and signals that are not easily discernible through traditional analysis, thereby gaining an edge in the market.

    ### Future Implementation
    This section will be expanded to include:
    -   Feature engineering based on the validated data.
    -   Selection and training of predictive models (e.g., Ridge Regression, Deep Learning models).
    -   Visualization of model predictions and performance metrics.
    -   Interactive components to adjust model parameters.
